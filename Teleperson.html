                    <p>The world has changed significantly since we first started buidling Teleperson in 2021. This was before ChatGPT and the hurried birth of Large Language Models (LLMs) which demonstrated at a blistering pace how machines can pass the once-daunting Turing Test.</p>

                <div class="Blog-header">
                    <h2>2024 is a different world than 2021</h2>
                    <p class="eighteen_p">There’s no doubt that LLMs have become particularly important in the realm of customer service, since companies are increasingly deploying LLMs (e.g., third-party chatbots that incorporate generative AI into their offerings) or building LLMs trained on internal data. As LLMs evolve, the percentage of customer service requests that can be handled through self-service, 24/7, while promising greater customer delight will inexorably expand. And the frustration of dealing with people will lessen as the need for people lessen with it.</p>
                    <p class="eighteen_p">While in Tokyo last month I spoke with an entrepreneur-turned-venture capitalist who noted the eventual—or inevitable—applications of AI in reducing customer pain and current friction across the customer service journey. He was right. The timing may be the thing though (as a recent article from the WSJ found); AI may not be living up to its hype, even as there seems to be a natural ceiling we’ve already hit in the world of LLMs or as OpenAI attains an eye-watering valuation of $157B.</p>
